id,disclaimer,div,"All loans available through National Debt Relief LLC are made by lenders in their network and are subject to eligibility criteria and review of creditworthiness and history. All loan and rate terms are subject to eligibility restrictions, application review, credit score, loan amount, loan term, lender approval, and credit usage and history. Eligibility for a loan is not guaranteed. Loans are not available to residents of all states – please call a National Debt Relief representative for further details. Repayment periods range from 24 to 60 months. The range of APRs on loans is 6.25% to a maximum of 35.99%. APR. The APR calculation includes all applicable fees, including the loan origination fee. For Example, a four year $18,000 loan with an interest rate of 18.134% and corresponding APR of 21.08% would have an estimated monthly payment of $528.79 and a total cost payable of $8,281.48. NMLS #1250950
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, you will be asked for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. You may also be asked to see your driver's license or other identifying documents."

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, you will be asked for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. You may also be asked to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.

All loans available through National Debt Relief LLC are made by lenders in their network and are subject to eligibility criteria and review of creditworthiness and history. All loan and rate terms are subject to eligibility restrictions, application review, credit score, loan amount, loan term, lender approval, and credit usage and history. Eligibility for a loan is not guaranteed. Loans are not available to residents of all states – please call a National Debt Relief representative for further details. Repayment periods range from 24 to 60 months. The range of APRs on loans is 6.25% to a maximum of 35.99%. APR. The APR calculation includes all applicable fees, including the loan origination fee. For Example, a four year $18,000 loan with an interest rate of 18.134% and corresponding APR of 21.08% would have an estimated monthly payment of $528.79 and a total cost payable of $8,281.48.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, you will be asked for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. You may also be asked to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.
